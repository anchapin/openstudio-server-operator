# Singleton gate (issue #14, D05): exactly one OSCM CR per namespace is served
# — the oldest. ``singleton``'s own @kopf.on.event / @kopf.on.startup handlers
# police conflicts (Warning Events + loud logs), and this call centrally wraps
# every OSCM @kopf.timer registered above so all handler modules are gated
# without editing their files. MUST run after the handler modules are imported
# (it is); future handler modules: add them to the import block above and the
# gate picks them up here automatically. Idempotent.
